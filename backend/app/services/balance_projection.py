"""Daily projected balance: what the money will be on each day ahead.

``load_projection_base`` gathers every known balance move (posted rows,
forecast rows and virtual recurring occurrences) into a seed and per-day
deltas. ``walk`` turns that base into a daily balance, optionally spending a
daily allowance on every day from today on. The calendar and the spending
plan both read balances through here, so the two never disagree.
