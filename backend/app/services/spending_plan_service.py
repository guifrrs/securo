"""The daily spending plan: one allowance for every variable expense.

Fixed costs (recurring bills) and planned costs (future-dated transactions)
already sit in the balance projection. The plan spends a daily allowance on
every day from today on, and answers three questions: how much is left to
spend today, how much a day the balance can afford, and until when the
balance stays above the floor.
